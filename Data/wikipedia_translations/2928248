Georges Pelletier d'Oisy
Capitaine Georges Pelletier d'Oisy (1892–1953) was a French aviator and World War I ace. He attempted a circumnavigation of the world in 1924.
Pelletier d'Oisy began his aviation career as a World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories.
On 24 April 1924, Pelletier d'Oisy and Adjutant Lucien Besin departed Paris eastbound in a Breguet 19.A.2 in an attempt to fly around the world. Their attempt ended when they crashed their airplane on a golf course in Shanghai, China. They had covered 10,580 miles (17,037 km) in 26 days.
Pelletier d'Oisy was in Hong Kong when a British Royal Air Force team of aviators making an eastbound attempt to circumnavigate the world arrived there on 30 June 1924, and he traded flying stories with Squadron Leader Archibald Stuart-MacLaren and Flying Officer William Plenderleith of the British team. Shortly after that, he departed for Tokyo, Japan, in a Breguet 14 he had borrowed from the Republic of China government, arriving there on 17 July 1924. The entire trip from Paris to Tokyo had taken 120 hours in the air over 84 days.
In June 1925, flying a Blériot-SPAD S.61, he won the Michelin Cup, completing the course in in 15hr 8 min.
