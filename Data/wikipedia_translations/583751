Turkish copula
This article supplements the general articles on the copula and Turkish grammar.
In linguistics, a copula (plural: copulas or copulae) is a word used to link the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement), such as the word "is" in the sentence "The sky is blue." The word "copula" derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that connects two different things.
The English infinitive "to be" is rendered in Turkish as "olmak", while "existence" is "varlık". The latter word is the abstract noun derived from "var", which is an adjective meaning "existing" or "present". Both "olmak" and "varlık" are used to render Aristotle's ("") (in the "Metaphysics", line 1003a21, beginning of Book IV): Aristotle's Greek is "being as such" or "being "qua" being" in English; in Turkish, it is "varlık olmak bakımından varlık" "existence from the point of view of being existence".
The infinitive "olmak" has the stem "ol-", whose root meaning is "become". This verb is regular in its conjugation, as are all Turkish verbs, with the exception of one defective verb, whose stem is "i-" and which means "be". The missing forms of "i-" are supplied by "ol-": the infinitive "olmak" is an example, since there is no infinitive "*imek". (An infinitive "ermek" appeared in ancient texts; its stem "er-" became the current "i-" VIII,2 in both editions.)
The various functions of the English "am-was-be" are accomplished in Turkish in (at least) six different ways:
Thus, the role of a copula can be played by two different verbs, an adjective, a suffix, juxtaposition, and affixation. The six constructions collectively show three ways of negation:
Because Turkish has no verb for "have", "var" or "olmak" is used in expressions of possession: "çekiç" "hammer", "çekicim" "my hammer"; "Çekicim var" "I have a hammer"; "Çekicim olsaydı" "If I had a hammer".
