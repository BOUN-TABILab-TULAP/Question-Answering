History and profile.
"2000'e Doğru" was established in January 1987 by Doğu Perinçek. The publisher was Sistem Yayıncılık. In 1989 it had a circulation of around 22,000, and was the second-highest circulation news weekly behind "Nokta". Contributors included Halil Berktay, Aziz Nesin, Musa Anter, Turan Dursun and Soner Yalçın.
In 1987 editor Fatma Yazici was sentenced to one year and four months for "insulting" President Kenan Evren. Within the first two years the magazine had had 28 cases brought against it by the government, and editor Yazici had been sentenced to over eight years in prison. Several 1987 issues repeating statements made by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk about autonomy for Kurds were confiscated before publication.
The "2000'e Doğru" edition of 16 February 1992 reported that eyewitnesses and sympathizers of Kurdish Hizbollah had informed them that members of the organization were trained in the headquarters of Turkey's rapid deployment force ("Çevik Kuvvet") in Diyarbakır. Two days after the article was published, its author, Halit Güngen, was killed by unidentified murderers. Another "2000'e Doğru" journalist killed in 1992 was Mecit Akgün, allegedly by the PKK.
