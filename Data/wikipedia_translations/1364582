Korku language
The Korku language is the language of the Korku tribe of central India. It belongs to the Kolarian or Munda family, isolated in the midst of a Dravidian (Gondi) population. Some alternate names for Korku are: Bondeya, Bopchi, Korki, Kuri, Kurku, Kurku-Ruma, Ramekhera.
Korkus are also closely associated with the Nihali people, many of whom have traditionally lived in special quarters of Korku villages. Korku is spoken by approximately 574,000 people, mainly in four districts of southern Madhya Pradesh (Khandwa, Harda, Betul, Hoshangabad) and three districts of northern Maharashtra (Rajura and Korpana tahsils of Chandrapur district, Manikgarh pahad area near Gadchandur in Chandrapur district) (Amravati, Buldana, Akola). Korku is spoken in a declining number of villages and is gradually being replaced by Hindi.

A few groups have been more successful in preserving their language, specifically the Potharia Korku (from the Vindhya Mountains).
Korku has been classified as an endangered language of India. A census taken in 2001 reported 574,481 people claiming to speak Korku, an un-scheduled language
