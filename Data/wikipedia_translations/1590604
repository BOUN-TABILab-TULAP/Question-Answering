Amanush
Amanush (English:Inhuman) is a 1975 Indian action drama film made in both Hindi and Bengali produced and directed by Shakti Samanta. The film stars Sharmila Tagore, Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutt and Asit Sen.
The Bengali version of the film achieved immense popularity amongst Bengalis and featured many memorable songs by Kishore Kumar like Bipinbabur karansudha and Ki asha-y baandhi khelaghar. Also, this film featured the Bengali film star Uttam Kumar at the height of his popularity and Utpal Dutt turned in a typically stellar performance as the villain.
The film was later remade in Telugu as "Edureeta" (1977) starring N.T.Rama Rao, Vanisri, and Jayasudha, in Malayalam as "Ithaa Oru Manushyan" and in Tamil as "Thyagam" with Sivaji Ganesan. After Amanush, Samanta once again made another double version, "Anand Ashram" (1977) with the same lead actors, however that film didn't do well at the box office.
