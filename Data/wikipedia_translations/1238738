Agia Pelagia
Agia Pelagia (Dimos Gaziou) is a seaside fishing village built in the centre of a picturesque amphitheatric bay, 23 km northwest from Heraklion capital city of the island of Crete.
It takes its name from the homonymous church, in the Monastery of the Sebbathians, ruins of which are found at a distance of 1 km west of the village. The town also has sandy beaches that attract tourists.
In Agia Pelagia there are the post-minoan graves and the University (Pritanion) of the 4th century BC which were found in 1970 at the site "Kladistos" or "Kladotos". Also there is a nearby cave, with the name "Evresi", where - according to legend - local people found the icon of Agia Pelagia.
