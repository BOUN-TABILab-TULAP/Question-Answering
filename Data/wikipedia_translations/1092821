DYO Boya Fabrikaları Inc. is an İzmir, Turkey-based company founded in 1954, originally named "Durmuş Yaşar ve Oğulları Boya, Vernik ve Reçine Fabrikaları A.Ş.", and based on licensing from Sadolin & Holmblad of Denmark. DYO stands for "Durmuş Yaşar ve Oğulları" ("Durmuş Yaşar & Sons)".
In 1957, "Sadolin ve Yaşarin A.Ş." ("Sadolin & Yaşarin") was founded to produce resins for paint production - based on licensing from "Sadolin & Holmblad". This company became in 1962 "DYO ve Sadolin Sentetik Selülozik Boya ve Vernik Fabrikaları A.Ş."

In 1967, DYOSAD made a "Harris Brush" factory, and in 1968, DYOSAD began producing and marketing inks - on licensing from "Sadolin & Holmblad".

From the beginning DYO and later Sadolin ve Yasarin and DYOSAD the joint ventures were run by Selçuk Yaşar (oldest son of "Durmuş Yaşar") - in close cooperation with Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin, (the only son of Gunnar Asgeir Sadolin, the founder of "Sadolin & Holmblad"), who was Joint President and International CEO of "Sadolin & Holmblad".
In 1979 – 25 years after the first factory establishment, DYO and DYOSAD in Turkey had become bigger than the domestic paint and ink activities in Denmark of "Sadolin & Holmblad" - in terms of both net revenue, net profit and number of employees. However, DYO and DYOSAD never counted for more than 10 % of the net revenue, net profit or number of employees of the entire "Sadolin & Holmblad " group, which were active with more than 60 factories sites in over 40 countries, and had sales in more than 100 countries.

At the same of the merger of DYO and DYOSAD in 2000, Yaşar Holding acquired both DYOSAD's 49.5% and Akzo Nobel's 50.5% shareholding in DYO SADOLIN Inks, and the company changed its name to "DYO Inks Manufacturing & Trade" - making it a 100% owned subsidiary Yaşar Holding and thereby a sister company to the new DYO (the paint business).
