Hammondia hammondi
Hammondia hammondi is an obligate heteroxenous protozoon of domestic cats (final host). Intracellular cysts develop mainly in striated muscle. After the ingestion of cysts by cats, a multiplicative cycle precedes the development of gametocytes in the epithelium of the small intestine (each oocyst of the species averaging 11×13 μm). Oocyst shedding persists for 10 to 28 days followed by immunity. Cysts in skeletal muscle measure between 100 and 340 μm in length and 40 and 95 μm in width. Some of the intermediate hosts (guinea pigs, hamsters, etc studied) develop low levels of antibody and some cross-immunity against "Toxoplasma".
