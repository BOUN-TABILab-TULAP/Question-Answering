International Centre for Automotive Technology
The International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT), Manesar is a division of NATIS (NATRIP Implementation Society), an independent registered society and apex body for implementation of National Automotive Testing and R& D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP), Govt. of India in the northern region. ICAT is a notified testing agency and works towards the development of automobile industry in the country. iCAT was set up in 2006 and is the first of the new world class centres coming up under the National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRiP). NATRiP itself is part of the ambitious Automotive Mission Plan 2016 which aims to support the Indian automotive industry to report a turnover of $145 billion, accounting to about 10 percent of GDP besides, offering additional employment to 25 million people. In line with this target, NATRiP is setting up testing centres in Ahmednagar, Chennai, Indore, Manesar, Pune, Silchar and Rae Bareilly. iCAT is expected to fill a longstanding void in the country through its state-of-the-art testing, validation and research and development facilities, particularly to OEMs and component manufacturers, in North India, which till now had to depend on ARAI in Pune and VRDE in Ahmednagar.
The Rs 500 crore facility has facilities for vehicle homologation and also testing laboratories for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and passive safety. It also includes a powertrain laboratory, engine dynamometers, emission laboratory with Euro-V capability, a fatigue laboratory, passive safety laboratory, and vehicle test tracks. iCAT is also being developed as a Centre of Excellence (CoE) for component development and NVH. Tyagi says, “We have so far invested Rs 65 crore and Rs 500 crore investments are in the pipeline. The entire project will be ready by end of calendar year 2011.”.
