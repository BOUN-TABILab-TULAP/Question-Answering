History.
It was founded by Frederik Paulsen Sr in Malmö, Sweden, in 1950, initially as the Nordiska Hormon Laboratoriet, renamed Ferring in 1954. A "ferring" in Frisian is a person from the island Föhr off the western coast of Germany. Mr. Paulsen's family originates from that island. Its Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was in 2014 the son of the founder, Frederik Paulsen Jr. 
The first major breakthrough was the synthetic production of oxytocin and vasopressin in 1961. With further growth and expansion, the headquarters moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, and subsequently to Saint-Prex, Switzerland, where Ferring Holding SA is now located. Dutch subsidiary Ferring B.V. expanded to the US in 1980. The company holds over 5,000 employees with manufacturing facilities in Europe, South America, China and has built two new facilities in the US and in India. Products are used in reproductive health, gastroenterology, urology, orthopaedics and endocrinology.
Ferring established a research group at the Ferring Research Institute in San Diego, CA (USA) in 1996. Ferring assembled a peptide research group that collaborates with academic scientists. The Ferring Research Institute moved to its new home in San Diego in February 2009 with the opening of a 38,000-square-foot facility in Sorrento Valley. The new facility houses expanded research laboratories for peptide medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, bioanalytical, and pharmacology.
In 2012, Ferring Pharmaceuticals funded the Ferring Research Infertility and Gynaecology Grant.
