Hiragana
Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. Each possible syllable in the Japanese language (strictly, each mora) is represented by one character in each system. This may be either a vowel such as ""a"" (hiragana ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as ""ka"" (); or ""n"" (), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English "m", "n", or "ng" (), or like the nasal vowels of French. Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of ん "n"), the kana are referred to as syllabaries and not alphabets. 
Hiragana is used to write native words for which there are no kanji, including grammatical particles such as "kara" "from", and suffixes such as "~san" "Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms." Likewise, hiragana is used to write words whose kanji form is obscure, not known to the writer or readers, or too formal for the writing purpose. There is also some flexibility for words that have common kanji renditions to be optionally written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference. Verb and adjective inflections, as, for example, "be-ma-shi-ta" in , are written in hiragana, often following a verb or adjective root (here, "") that is written in kanji. When Hiragana is used to show the pronunciation of kanji characters as reading aid, it is referred to as "furigana". The article Japanese writing system discusses in detail how the various systems of writing are used.
There are two main systems of ordering hiragana, the old-fashioned iroha ordering, and the more prevalent gojūon ordering.
Writing system.
The modern hiragana syllabary consists of 46 characters:
These are conceived as a 5×10 grid ("gojūon", , lit. "Fifty Sounds"), as illustrated in the adjacent table, with the extra character being the anomalous singular consonant ん ("N"). 
Romanisation of the kana does not always strictly follow the consonant-vowel scheme laid out in the table. For example, ち, nominally "ti", is very often romanised as "chi" in an attempt to better represent the actual sound in Japanese.
These basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a "dakuten" marker ( ゛), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant: "k"→"g", "ts/s"→"z", "t"→"d", "h"→"b" and "ch"/"sh"→"j". Hiragana beginning with an "h" can also add a "handakuten" marker ( ゜) changing the "h" to a "p".
Hiragana küçük bir versiyonu "ya", "yu" ya da "yo" (ゃ, ゅ ya ょ, sırasıyla) "i" ile biten hiragana ilave edilebilir. Bu, "a", "u" ya da "o" bir kayma (palatalization) "i" ünlü sesi değiştirir. Küçük "y" kana eklenmesi Yoon denir. Örneğin, き ("Ki") artı ゃ (küçük "ya") olur ("kya").
A small "tsu" っ, called a "sokuon", indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). For example, compare "saka" "hill" with "sakka" "author". It also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop, as in ( Ouch!). However, it cannot be used to double the "na", "ni", "nu", "ne", "no" syllables' consonants – to double them, the singular "n" (ん) is added in front of the syllable.
Hiragana usually spells long vowels with the addition of a second vowel kana. The chōonpu (long vowel mark) (ー) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word , "rāmen", but this usage is considered non-standard. In informal writing, small versions of the five vowel kana are sometimes used to represent trailing off sounds ( "haa", "nee"). Standard and voiced iteration marks are written in hiragana as ゝ and ゞ respectively.
Table of hiragana.
The following table shows the complete hiragana together with the Hepburn romanization and IPA transcription in the "gojūon" order. Hiragana with "dakuten" or "handakuten" follow the "gojūon" kana without them, with the "yōon" kana following. Obsolete and normally unused kana are shown in gray. For all syllables besides ん, the pronunciation indicated is for word-initial syllables, for mid-word pronunciations see below.
𛀁 ) in pre-Classical Japanese (prior to the advent of kana), but is generally represented for purposes of reconstruction by the kanji 江, and its hiragana form is not present in any known orthography. In modern orthography, "ye" can also be written as いぇ (イェ in katakana). 
It's true that in early periods of kana, hiragana and katakana letters for "ye" were used, but soon after the distinction between /ye/ and /e/ went away, and letters and glyphs were not established.
This topic is too much advanced, and it's better to write in Early Middle Japanese.
In the middle of words, the "g" sound (normally ) often turns into a velar nasal and less often (although increasing recently) into the voiced velar fricative . An exception to this is numerals; 15 "juugo" is considered to be one word, but is pronounced as if it was "jū" and "go" stacked end to end: .
Additionally, the "j" sound (normally ) can be pronounced in the middle of words. For example "sūji" 'number'.
In archaic forms of Japanese, there existed the "kwa" ( ) and "gwa" ( ) digraphs. In modern Japanese, these phonemes have been phased out of usage and only exist in the extended katakana digraphs for approximating foreign language words.
The singular "n" is pronounced before "t", "ch", "ts", "n", "r", "z", "j" and "d", before "m", "b" and "p", before "k" and "g", at the end of utterances, before vowels, palatal approximants ("y"), consonants "s", "sh", "h", "f" and "w", and finally after the vowel "i" if another vowel, palatal approximant or consonant "s", "sh", "h", "f" or "w" follows.
In kanji readings, the diphthongs "ou" and "ei" are today usually pronounced (long o) and (long e) respectively. For example (lit. "toukyou") is pronounced 'Tokyo', and "sensei" is 'teacher'. However, "tou" is pronounced 'to inquire', because the "o" and "u" are considered distinct, "u" being the infinitive verb ending. Similarly, "shite iru" is pronounced 'is doing'.

Spelling rules.
With a few exceptions for sentence particles は, を, and へ (pronounced as "wa", "o", and "e"), and a few other arbitrary rules, Japanese, when written in kana, is phonemically orthographic, i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between kana characters and sounds, leaving only words' pitch accent unrepresented. This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as historical kana usage, differed substantially from pronunciation; the three above-mentioned exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system. The old spelling is referred to as .
There are two hiragana pronounced "ji" (じ and ぢ) and two hiragana pronounced "zu" (ず and づ), but to distinguish them, sometimes "ぢ" is written as "di" and "づ" is written as dzu. These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, "ji" is written as じ and "zu" is written as ず. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a "dakuten" and the same syllable with a "dakuten", the same hiragana is used to write the sounds. For example "chijimeru" ('to boil down' or 'to shrink') is spelled ちぢめる and "tsudzuku" ('to continue') is . For compound words where the dakuten reflects "rendaku" voicing, the original hiragana is used. For example, "chi" ( 'blood') is spelled ち in plain hiragana. When "hana" ('nose') and "chi" ('blood') combine to make "hanaji" 'nose bleed'), the sound of changes from "chi" to "dji". So "hanadji" is spelled according to ち: the basic hiragana used to transcribe . Similarly, "tsukau" (; 'to use') is spelled in hiragana, so "kanazukai" (; 'kana use', or 'kana orthography') is spelled in hiragana.
However, this does not apply when kanji are used phonetically to write words which do not relate directly to the meaning of the kanji (see also ateji). The Japanese word for 'lightning', for example, is "inazuma" (). The component means 'rice plant', is written in hiragana and is pronounced: "ina". The component means 'wife' and is pronounced "tsuma" (つま) when written in isolation—or frequently as "zuma" when it features after another syllable. Neither of these components have anything to do with 'lightning', but together they do when they compose the word for 'lightning'. In this case, the default spelling in hiragana rather than is used.

No standard Japanese words begin with the kana ん ("n"). This is the basis of the word game shiritori. ん "n" is normally treated as its own syllable and is separate from the other "n"-based kana ("na", "ni" etc.). A notable exception to this is the colloquial negative verb conjugation; for example "wakaranai" meaning " don't understand" is rendered as "wakaran". It is however not a contraction of the former, but instead comes from the classic negative verb conjugation ぬ "nu" ( "wakaranu").
ん is sometimes directly followed by a vowel ("a", "i", "u", "e" or "o") or a palatal approximant ("ya", "yu" or "yo"). These are clearly distinct from the "na", "ni" etc. syllables, and there are minimal pairs such as "kin'en" 'smoking forbidden', "kinen" 'commemoration', "kinnen" 'recent years'. In Hepburn romanization, they are distinguished with an apostrophe, but not all romanization methods make the distinction. For example past prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's first name is actually "Jun'ichirō" pronounced 
There are a few hiragana which are rarely used. ゐ "wi" and ゑ "we" are obsolete outside of Okinawan dialects. ゔ "vu" is a modern addition used to represent the /v/ sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese from a phonological standpoint does not have a /v/ sound, it is pronounced as /b/ and mostly serves as a more accurate indicator of a word's pronunciation in its original language. However, it is rarely seen because loanwords and transliterated words are usually written in katakana, where the corresponding character would be written as ヴ. , , for "ja"/"ju"/"jo" are theoretically possible in rendaku, but are practically never used. For example 'throughout Japan' could be written , but is practically always 
The "myu" kana is extremely rare in originally Japanese words; linguist Haruhiko Kindaichi raises the example of the Japanese family name Omamyūda and claims it is the only occurrence amongst pure Japanese words. Its katakana counterpart is used in many loanwords, however.
History.
Hiragana developed from "man'yōgana", Chinese characters used for their pronunciations, a practice which started in the 5th century. The oldest example of Man'yōgana is Inariyama Sword which is an iron sword excavated at the Inariyama Kofun in 1968. This sword is thought to be made in year of (which is A.D. 471 in commonly accepted theory).
The forms of the hiragana originate from the cursive script style of Chinese calligraphy. The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from manyōgana via cursive script. The upper part shows the character in the regular script form, the center character in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. Note also that the cursive script forms are not strictly confined to those in the illustration.
Male authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with katakana writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.
Originally, for all syllables there was more than one possible hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each syllable had only one hiragana. The deprecated hiragana are now known as .
10. yüzyıldan kalma pangram şiiri "Iroha-uta" ("ABC şarkı / şiir"), bir kez her Hiragana kullanmaktadır (hariç "n" ん, Muromachi döneminden önce む sadece bir varyant olduğu).

Unicode.
Hiragana was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.
The Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040–U+309F:
The Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and yōon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic ゐ "wi" and ゑ "we" and the rare ゔ "vu"; the archaic 𛀁 "ye" is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with "dakuten" and "handakuten" used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.
Characters U+3095 and U+3096 are small か ("ka") and small け ("ke"), respectively. U+309F is a ligature of より ("yori") occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.
Historic and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0.
The Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000–U+1B0FF:
