Biography.
Soygeniş was born in Ankara, and went to school at Kabataş Erkek Lisesi. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1982 from Istanbul Technical University. He started his Master of Architecture studies at Middle East Technical University and went to University at Buffalo upon receipt of a fellowship and received his Master of Architecture degree there in 1985. He worked as architect in the USA between 1985 and 1990 and traveled in North America, Europe and Turkey to experience architectural spots. He founded his own architectural studio in 1990. He has been a faculty member at the Yildiz Technical University School of Architecture since 1995 (Dean: 2010-2013). His work has been published in various magazines, books and newspapers, and exhibited in the USA, Europe and Turkey. His approach to architecture was reviewed in the Middle East Journal as ""defining the purpose of architecture as that of creating space for a designated function. Sema and Murat Soygeniş examine interior and exterior space, simple and innovative detailing and the advancement of quality and functionality."" He is member of many organizations including the UIA Chamber of Architects, the American Institute of Architects (Director - Southern Europe Section of AIA Europe: 2011-2012), and professionally registered as architect by State of Maryland. 
Work.
Murat Soygenis’ work include industrial plants, houses, post-disaster housing proposals, urban design projects and furniture design. Common design denominator of all projects regardless of scale is the impetus to emphasize components and hardware of each designed product by careful application of color, innovative detailing and use of ordinary materials. At first look, every designed product – an urban design project, a small-size, renovated interior space or storage unit - displays its prominent parts. Details of an industrial plant with hundreds of squaremeters of area or aluminum plate, bolt, washer and nut holding doors of a small storage unit all brought together meticulously.
Exhibitions.
Various personal and group exhibition of architectural work in USA, Europe and Turkey.
Projects were on display in Baltimore, Buffalo, Philadelphia, New York and throughout Turkey, 1981-today
