Marriage and divorce.

Kate and her spouse Jon separated in September 2013. She said the separation was "incredibly painful" and, after seven years of marriage, will be divorcing.
"When Jon and I first parted it was quite hard to put my personal life aside," Connerty explained. "But then it became therapeutic to concentrate on my job. People call it 'Doctor Theatre' - when you're acting, you can't worry about things."
