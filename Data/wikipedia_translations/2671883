History.
In 2004, G.R.O. was an artist collaboration line under the parent company Genetik Gear. Artists that participated in the collaboration were not given a direction of what to design, but a concept based on the acronym “G.R.O.”, which stood for Grass Roots Organization. The artists were encouraged to develop their ideas by researching in depth about inspirations from the past, and evolve their research into designs that reflect something new but recognizable. 
After the discontinuation of the Genetik line in 2007, brand developer Dylan Wages was able to expand on the original concepts of the Grass Roots Organization. Throughout the expansion to a standalone brand, the Grass Roots Organization evolved into a singular vision known as The GRO Project. 
The Gro Project consists of multi-talented individuals from different disciplines such as B-boys, sneaker connoisseurs, DJs, snowboarders, climbers and freestyle artists alike.
