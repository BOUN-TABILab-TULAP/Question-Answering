The Kočerin Tablet is the longest medieval tablet written in Bosnian Cyrillic. It was made in 1404 on the bottom of a tombstone in the cemetery of Viginja Miloševič, a historical village, located close to the village of Kočerin, 9 kilometers away from the city of Široki Brijeg. The tablet was discovered in Kocerin Field. The tombstone that the tablet that was written on top of was discovered in 1983 in Lipovci. In 1872, it was moved to Kočerin to the right side of the priest's office. In 1927, a new church was built in Kocerin and a copy of the inscription was placed there. In 2004, it was moved to the inside of the Priest's office.
