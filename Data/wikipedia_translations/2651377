Yapı Kredi was acquired by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet's Çukurova Holding in 1984, and Hüsnü Özyeğin became its general manager (until 1987). In 2003 Çukurova Holding reached an agreement with the Turkish bank regulator to sell the majority of its shares in Yapı Kredi within two years. In 2005 the majority of shares in Yapı Kredi were acquired by the owners of Koçbank. Koç Finansal Hizmetler (KFH; Koç Financial Services, KFS), was an equal partnership between Koç Holding and Italian banking giant UniCredit. In 2006 Koçbank was merged into Yapı Kredi, leaving 80% of Yapı Kredi owned by KFS.
