Ashiq Qurbani
Ashik Qurbani, or Kurbani, (, ) is one of the most prominent ashiks of all times.
Qurbani, or was born in 1477 in Dirili. He was a contemporary of Shah Ismail and may have served as the court musician. According to folk traditions, Qurbani became an ashik via divine intervention in a dream. In the same dream, he sees a big palace and a beautiful maiden in the garden. The girl is also looking at him. A Saint holds one hand of the girl; the second Saint holds the other and puts a love potion into the hand of the girl... Qurbani opens his eyes while he is trying to embrace
the girl, but realizes that it has all been a dream. Thus he falls in love with the maiden whose name was Perizat (Pari). This tradition is the basis of a famous ashik hikaye, known as "Qurbani and Pari".
Kurban adlı kompozisyonları.
Qurbani's compositions were handed down as gems of oral art from generation to generation and constitute a necessary repertoire of every ashik. A famous qushma, titled Violet, starts as the following: 
<poem>
Başina mən dönüm ala göz Pəri, --- ("O my dearest, my love, my beautiful green-eyed Pari")
Adətdir dərələr yaz bənəvşəni. --- ("Custom bids us pluck violets when spring days begin")
Ağ nazik əlinən dər dəstə bağla, --- ("With your tender white hand gather a nosegay,")
Tər buxaq altinə düz bənəvşəni... --- ("Pin it under your dainty chin...")
