Controversy.
CNN Turk was one of the Turkish news channels which were criticized for not covering the 2013–14 protests in Turkey. On June 2, 2013 at 1am, CNN Turk was broadcasting a documentary on penguins while CNN International was showing live coverage of the protests in Turkey.
""the afternoon of Friday, May 31, 2013" CNN Turk was broadcasting a food show, featuring the “flavors of Niğde.” Other major Turkish news channels were showing a dance contest and a roundtable on study-abroad programs. It was a classic case of the revolution not being televised. The whole country seemed to be experiencing a cognitive disconnect, with Twitter saying one thing, the government saying another, and the television off on another planet."
In 2014, it showed a documentary on bees as Turkish Kurds undertook major protests about Ankara's refusal to support Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State in Kobanê.
