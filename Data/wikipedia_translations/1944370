Çarşamba, Istanbul
Çarşamba is a neighbourhood () of Istanbul, Turkey. It is part of the district of Fatih, inside the walls of the ancient Byzantine city of Constantinople. It is one of the most Islamically conservative areas of the city. It is rich with Byzantine monuments, like the mosques of Fethiye and Hirami Ahmet Pasha. According to 17th-century Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi, the name of the neighborhood comes from the city of Çarşamba on the Black Sea since, after the Fall of Constantinople, this part of Istanbul was repopulated with people coming from that city. In Turkish Çarşamba means "Wednesday" and a famous street market is organized every week on this day, the "Çarşamba Pazarı" ("Çarşamba Market", but also "Wednesday Market").
