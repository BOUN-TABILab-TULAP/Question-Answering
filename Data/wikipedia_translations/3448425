Date and time notation in Turkey
In Turkey, the little endian date format is used and 12-hour clock is more common than 24-hour clock system. 
Date.
In Turkey dates are written in the form DD.MM.YYYY, or "DD <name of the month> YYYY" (little endian format). It is rare to use abbreviations for names of months.
Time.
Turkey uses the 24-hour clock system. In informal speech, however, the 12-hour clock is more commonly used. When speaking in the 12-hour system, the words such as "sabah" (morning), "akşam" (evening) or "gece" (night) are generally used before telling the time to clarify whether it is a.m. or p.m. (i.e., sabah 9 means 9 a.m. and akşam 5 means 5 p.m.). An exception is that the hours 12.30 AM/PM are usually both referred to as "yarım" (meaning half).
