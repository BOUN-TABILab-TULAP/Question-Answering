VLS-1
The VLS-1 () is the Brazilian Space Agency's main satellite launch vehicle. The launch vehicle will be capable of launching satellites into orbit. The launch site is located at the Alcântara Launch Center due to its proximity to the equator.
Associated vehicles include the Sonda I, Sonda II, Sonda III and Sonda IV, the VS-30, VS-40 and VSB-30.
History.
VLS-1 development started in 1984, after the first launch of the Sonda IV rocket. To date, three prototypes have been built and two launches attempted, departing from the Alcântara Launch Center. During the V1 and V2 prototype launches (VLS-1 V1 and VLS-1 V2) technical problems prevented mission success, but allowed the testing of several vehicle components. The V3 prototype exploded on the launch pad on 22 August 2003, two days before its intended launch date. The 2003 Alcântara VLS accident caused a considerable setback to the Brazilian space program.
The V4 prototype is currently under development and expected to be launched in 2013.

Developments.
VLM.
The VLM ("Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites") based on the S50 rocket engine is being studied, with the objective of orbiting satellites up to 150 kg in circular orbits ranging from 250 to 700 km. It will be a three-stage rocket, expected to launch the SHEFEX III mission by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 2016.
"Cruzeiro do Sul" (Southern Cross) program.
VLS Alfa.
In the framework of the proposed Cruzeiro do Sul program, the VLS-1 rocket is the basis of the VLS Alfa project.
L5 rocket based configuration - three-stage rocket, with the upper stage being liquid-fuel, putting 200 to 400 kg satellites into low equatorial orbits:
L75 rocket based configuration - two-stage rocket, with the upper stage being liquid-fuel, putting 500 kg satellites equatorial orbits up to 750 km:
VLS Beta.
The VLS Beta is another related project, intended to lift up to 800 kg payloads to an 800 km equatorial orbit.
Three-stage rocket, with the upper two stages being liquid-fuel.
Projected flights are:
VLS Gama.
The VLS Gama is intended to carry up to 1000 kg payloads to an 800 km polar orbit. Three-stage liquid-fuel rocket.
VLS Delta.
The VLS Delta is capable of placing 2000 kg payloads in a geostationary orbit. Three-stage liquid-fuel rocket (VLS BETA body) with two solid fuel boosters.
VLS Epsilon.
The VLS Epsilon is capable of placing 4000 kg payloads in a geostationary orbit. Three-stage liquid-fuel rocket (VLS BETA body) with two liquid-fuel boosters.
