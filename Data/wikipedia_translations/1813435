Richard Bachynsky [http://www.greenparty.ca/en/campaign/35021]
Richard Bachynsky is an environmentalist, writer, and consultant. Richard has been active in environmental interests since the mid-1980s, when he began to travel as a consultant. He was to see the complete disregard for environmental issues evident in both developing countries and North America.
Richard was born and raised in the Windsor area, and has seen the rapid decline of the region in terms of jobs, environmental issues, and health related issues. With the failure of recent members of Parliament to attract new industry, improve the environment, or create better infrastructure, members of the community are motivated for change.
A region rich in agriculture, industry, and resources, it is inconceivable – but true – that the region has one of Canada’s highest unemployment rates. The residents of the region are being shortchanged, and need better federal support for job creation, tourism promotion, small business assistance, health care, and seniors.
Active in finance, Richard has worked towards establishing new green industries including tire and industrial waste rubber recycling, biodiesel fuel plants, and alternative energy development worldwide. He also has extensive experience in real estate management and financing, and has served as a consultant for numerous firms completing projects both in Canada, and internationally. He currently holds of the position of Vice President International Sales and Finance for GreenShift Corporation, NY, NY USA, is Head of Export Finance Department, Roberts &Schaefer Engineering and Construction, USA., Finance Dir for Alternativa Corporation, Ukraine and is a Broker for Argentum Mortgages Toronto, and a consultant for Bachynsky Group, Bachynsky Realty Inc., and Bachynsky Mortgage Corporation, Windsor. 
Richard holds an MBA and is certified as a mortgage broker in Ontario. He is a member of the Board of the Amherstburg Chamber of Commerce. Previously, he was a member of parent and teacher association of F.J. Brennan High School in Windsor, and of the OMBA. In addition, he was active as a coach for minor hockey for the Windsor Minor Hockey Association, Riverside Hockey Association, and the Patterson Chiefs Hockey Program. Richard is the parent of 3 teenagers Erik, Laura, and Daniel.
Richard Bachynsky was the candidate for the Green Party of Canada for the Federal election of 2008.
Richard Bachynsky is currently the nominated candidate for the Green Party of Canada for the riding of Windsor-Tecumseh.
