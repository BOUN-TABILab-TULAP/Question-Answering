How to perform Akisutozeneko.
"(Incorrect somewhere)"
"Akisutozeneko" is performed by changing the letters of your name into numbers.
1) First change any vowels into numbers (a=1、i=2、u=3、e=4、o=5、n=1)
For example:
俗語太郎＝ぞくごたろう = Zokugo Tarou = 535153
 辞書花美＝じしょはなみ = Jishi(o) Hanami = 223112
"(No 'small Hiragana' are used for this fortune telling method.)"
2) Next, eliminate any numbers that you both share in common.
俗語太郎 ＝ ぞくごたろう=Zokugo Tarou = 535153 = 5+5+5 = 15
辞書花美 ＝ じしょはなみ=Jishi(o) Hanami = 223112 = 2+2+2 = 6
3) Now each number has an associated letter:
あ=a=1
き=ki=2
す=su=3
と=to=4
ぜ=ze=5
ね=ne=6
こ=ko=7
あ=a=8
き=ki=9
etc.
Zokugo Tarou being 15, he will be "ne"
Jisho Hanami is 6, which is also "ne".
Therefore their fortune together is netsuretsu. (passionate)
