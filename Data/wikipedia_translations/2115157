History.
The village was founded by the Ottoman Turks in the 14th century. It was known as "Büyük Dervent" in Turkish, and Голям Дервент "Golyam Dervent" in Bulgarian. According to Anastas Razboynikov, its population in 1830 was 700 Bulgarians and 50 Turks, in 1878 400 Bulgarians and 80 Turks and in 1912 420 Bulgarians and 80 Turks. According to professor Lyubomir Miletich, the 1912 population had around 300 Bulgarian exarchists. After a brief period of Bulgarian rule between 1913 and 1919, it became part of Greece. As a result its Bulgarian and Turkish population was exchanged with Greek refugees, mainly from today's Turkey. 300 Bulgarians moved northward into Burgas, Mokren (4 families), Zagortsi (4 families), Veselne, Mamarčevo, Sokolenči (2 families) and other villages. The name of the village was translated into Greek and became Mega Dereio.
