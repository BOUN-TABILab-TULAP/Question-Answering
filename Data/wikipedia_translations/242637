Kardeş Türküler
Kardeş Türküler (translated either as Brotherly Songs or as Ballads of Fraternity) is a contemporary Turkish ethnic/folkloric band. It was formed in 1993 with a series of stage performances given by the music branch of the Folklore Club at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, Turkey.
Origins.
The diverse ethnic groups in this ancient Anatolia region and the Balkans initially gave cause for the concerts to have artists perform interpretations of Anatolian folksongs in Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Assyrian, Azerbaijani, Georgian and Armenian. Under the auspices of the Boğaziçi Performing Arts Ensemble (BGST), formed in 1995, the program used the concert stage to advance the ideals of common ancestry and celebration of diversity as a to cultural polarization and ethnic tension. Eventually, the musical heritage of the Laz, Georgian, Circassian, Romani, Macedonian and Alevi cultures were all incorporated into the program. The scholarly collection and research of the diverse folklore traditions of the region is an important part of BGST’s activities, but Kardeş Türküler has been intent on forging its own music tradition as well.
