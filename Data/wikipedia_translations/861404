Silke Renk
Silke Renk (born June 30, 1967 in Querfurt, Saxony-Anhalt) is a retired javelin thrower from Germany.
She represented East Germany at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where she finished fifth, and at the 1990 European Championships where she finished fourth.
She then experienced her career highlight as she won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Renk won with a throw of 68.34 meters, defeating Natalya Shikolenko, who took home the silver medal, and compatriot Karen Forkel.
The next year she finished sixth at the 1993 World Championships. She withdrew from the 1994 European Championships because of knee injury problems, and never reached another international final despite starting at the 1995 World Championships and the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Her personal best was 71.00 meres with the old javelin type, achieved in June 1988 in Rostock. This ranks her third among German javelin throwers, only behind Petra Felke (who held the world record) and Antje Kempe.
