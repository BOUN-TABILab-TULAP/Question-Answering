Faik Türün
Faik Türün (17 October 1913, Bursa - 15 February 2003) was a Turkish general. He served in the Korean War as the Chief of Operations for the Turkish Brigade and was awarded the Silver Star by General Douglas MacArthur. He was the Commander of the First Army of Turkey during the 1971 Turkish coup d'état. He was one of the leading persons associated with the Counter-Guerrilla in the 1970s, and obstructed a coup plot of young "marxist" officers in that capacity, which was planned to take place on March 9, 1971 under the tutelage of the then Turkish Air Force commander General Muhsin Batur. He led Operation Sledgehammer (associated with the Ziverbey Villa) against these officers who were plotting a coup to establish "Turkish Peoples Democratic Republic", modeled after North Korean state system. After retirement from the Army, he was elected to Turkish Parliament as a deputy for the Justice Party from 1977, representing Manisa.
