Family background.
A native of Ankara, Emin Çölaşan was born into a Cretan Turkish family whose surname, which literally means "desert strider", is a reference to his grandfather who was exiled by Sultan Abdülhamid II deep into the Fizan desert interior of Libya for 7 years because of JeuneTurc movement. His maternal grandfather, Refik Şevket İnce, born in Polichnitos near Mytilene (modern-day Greek island of Lesbos), served with the country's leader, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and, subsequently, in ministerial posts during the 1920s and into the 1950s, and his father served in the State Meteorological Service where he was a general director for 14 years, one of the longest.

Controversies.
Çölaşan had been a virulent critic of Turgut Özal, Turkey's Prime Minister from 1983 to 1989, who became the target of his 1980s bestseller books "Turgut'un Serüveni" "Adventure" and "Turgut Nereden Koşuyor?" "is Turgut Running From?". In the late 2000s, he focused his in-print attacks upon rival columnists and Justice and Development Party (AKP) mayor of Ankara İ. Melih Gökçek. Çölaşan made a point of pronouncing the mayor's name in full, in reference to ; a practice for which he was fined 40,000 lira. The two finally appeared on a televised debate, which received a warning from the state censorship board for indecency. Çölaşan also criticized the incumbent AKP government, which is known to be the reason behind his 13 August 2007 firing from "Hürriyet" after 22 years of service.
