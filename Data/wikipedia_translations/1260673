Pennsylvania Route 88
Pennsylvania Route 88 (PA 88) is a northâ€“south state highway located in southwestern Pennsylvania. The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 119 in Point Marion less than from the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. The northern terminus is at Pennsylvania Route 51 in Pittsburgh. PA 88 runs parallel to the Monongahela River for almost its entire length.
Signed in 1927, PA 88 is one of the oldest state highways in Pennsylvania. For a brief period between 1927 and 1928, the route followed the Perry Highway between Pittsburgh and Erie. In 1928, the Perry Highway became U.S. Route 19.

History.
At one point, the route went north of Pittsburgh all the way to New Castle. The Pittsburgh-to-New Castle section was largely split off in 1961 to form Pennsylvania Route 65, in honor of the 65th Infantry Division of the United States Army during World War II. The 7.7 mile stretch of PA 88 from PA 65's current southern terminus at the West End Bridge to PA 88's current northern terminus was decommissioned.
Nonetheless, PA 88's legacy still survives in its former northern section. Four of PA 88's five spur routes (PA 288, PA 388, PA 488, & PA 588) are now spur routes of 65, but still retain the "88" base numbers. (PA 88 did retain PA 188 as a spur route.) In addition, a drive-in theater known as Spotlight 88 in North Sewickley Township retained its name after the route was rebadged as 65, and is still known by that name as its current incarnation as a flea market after the drive-in was destroyed by an F3 tornado on May 31, 1985.
PA 88 Truck.
Pennsylvania Route 88 Truck is a truck route in California, Pennsylvania. The route was created to allow access to the Pennsylvania Route 43 toll freeway and to allow large vehicles to avoid the large hill into the Monongahela Valley. The center of the route is at the PA 43 interchange, with a two-lane stretch providing access to California University of Pennsylvania and the surrounding business district, as well as connecting traffic with northbound Route 88; a four-lane stretch provides a more gradual ascent of the hill on Route 88 southbound.
